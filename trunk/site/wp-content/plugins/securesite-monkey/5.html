    <td id="readme_check">Check if WordPress <i>readme.html</i> file is accessible via HTTP on the default location.</td>
      <td><p>As mentioned in the previous test - you should be proud that your site is powered by WordPress but also hide the exact version you're using. <i>readme.html</i> contains WP version info and if left on the default location (WP root) attackers can easily find out your WP version.</p>
      <p>This is a very easy problem to solve. Rename the file to something more unique like "readme-876.html"; delete it; move it to another location or chmod it so that it's not accessible via HTTP.</p>
