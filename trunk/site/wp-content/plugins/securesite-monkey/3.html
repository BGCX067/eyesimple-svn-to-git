      <td><p>As with the WordPress core, keeping the themes up to date is one of the most important and easier way to keep your site secure. Since most themes are free and therefore their code is available to anyone having the latest version will ensure you're not prone to attacks based on known vulnerabilities. Also, having the latest version will ensure your theme is compatible with the latest version of WP.</p>
      <p>If you downloaded a theme from the official WP repository you can easily check if there are any upgrades available, and upgrade it by opening <a href="themes.php">Appearance - Themes</a>. If you bought the theme from ThemeForest be sure to check the theme's page and upgrade manually. <b>Remember</b> - always backup your files and database before upgrading!</p>
