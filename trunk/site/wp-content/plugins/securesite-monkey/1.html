      <td><p>Keeping the WordPress core up to date is one of the most important aspects of keeping your site secure. If vulnerabilities are discovered in WordPress and a new version is released to address the issue, the information required to exploit the vulnerability is almost certainly in the public domain. This makes old versions more open to attacks, and is one of the primary reasons you should always keep WordPress up to date.</p>
      <p>Thanks to automatic updates updating is very easy. Just go to <a href="update-core.php">Dashboard - Updates</a> and click "Upgrade". <b>Remember</b> - always backup your files and database before upgrading!</p>
