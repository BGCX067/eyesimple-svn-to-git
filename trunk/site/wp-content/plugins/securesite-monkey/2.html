      <td><p>As with the WordPress core, keeping plugins up to date is one of the most important and easier way to keep your site secure. Since most plugins are free and therefore their code is available to anyone having the latest version will ensure you're not prone to attacks based on known vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>If you downloaded a plugin from the official WP repository you can easily check if there are any upgrades available, and upgrade it by opening <a href="update-core.php">Dashboard - Updates</a>. If you bought the plugin from CodeCanyon be sure to check the item's page and upgrade manually. <b>Remember</b> - always backup your files and database before upgrading!</p>
