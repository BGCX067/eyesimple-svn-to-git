      <td><p>There have already been a couple of security issues regarding the <i>install.php</i> file. Once you install WP this file becomes useless and there's no reason to keep it in the default location and accessible via HTTP.</p>
      <p>This is a very easy problem to solve. Rename <i>install.php</i> (you'll find it in the <i>wp-admin</i> folder) to something more unique like "install-876.php"; delete it; move it to another location or chmod it so it's not accessible via HTTP.</p>
