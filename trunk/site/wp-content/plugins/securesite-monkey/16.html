      <td><p>Moving WP core files to any non-standard folder will make your site less vulnerable to automated attacks. Most scripts that script kiddies use rely on default file paths. If your blog is setup on <i>www.site.com</i> you can put WP files in ie: <i>/var/www/vhosts/site.com/www/wp-core/</i> instead of the obvious <i>/var/www/vhosts/site.com/www/</i>.</p>
      <p>Site and WP address can easily be changed in <a href="options-general.php">Options - General</a>. Before doing so please watch this detailed <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFfvBJVtzqA">video tutorial</a> which describes what other steps are necessary to move your WP core files to another location.</p>
